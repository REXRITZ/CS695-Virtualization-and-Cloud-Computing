For a fixed stride value, as the size of memory allocated to a process increases(in pages), total mapped physical memory also increases.
This means that number of pages allocated is directly proportional to mapped physical memory.

For fixed number of pages, we observe that as the stride value increases, the mapped physical memory decreases.
This happens because for large stride values, less writes to memory are done so number of physical pages mapped also reduces.
This means that number of strides is inversely proportional to mapped physical memory.
